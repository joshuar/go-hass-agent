Go Hass Agent reports various device sensors and measurements to, and can
receive desktop notifications from, Home Assistant. It can optionally provide
control of the device via MQTT. It runs as a tray icon application or without
any GUI in a headless mode, processing and sending/receiving data automatically.
The tray icon, if available, provides some actions to configure settings and
show reported sensors/measurements.
