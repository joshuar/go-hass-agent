# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest in Go Hass Agent! There are **lots** of ways you can contribute to this project:

- Helping with development.
- Helping with translations.
- Just using the agent and providing feedback.

## Development Contributions

I would welcome your contribution! If you find any improvement or issue you want
to fix, feel free to send a pull request!

Some documentation for development can be found in
the [docs](docs/README.md). There is information for developing
Go Hass Agent for different operating systems as well as adding additional
sensors. This might help anyone to look to contribute, extend or fork this tool.

## Translations

While this application does not have many points where text is displayed to
the end user (logging aside), translation is supported through the `language`
and `message` packages that are part of
[golang.org/x/text](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text).

I would welcome pull requests for translations!
