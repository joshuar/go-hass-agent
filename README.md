## üåü About the Project

Go Hass Agent is an application to expose sensors and controls from a device to
Home Assistant. You can think of it as something similar to the [Home Assistant
companion app](https://companion.home-assistant.io/) for mobile devices, but for
your desktop, server, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, toaster, whatever. If it can run Go
and Linux, it can run Go Hass Agent!

Out of the box, Go Hass Agent will report lots of details about the system it is
running on. You can extend it with additional sensors and controls by hooking it
up to MQTT. You can extend it **even further** with your own custom sensors and
controls with scripts/programs.

You can then use these sensors/controls in any automations and dashboards, just
like the companion app or any other "thing" you've added into Home Assistant.

### üéØ Features

- **Sensors:** Expose a number of sensor entities to Home Assistant, which can then be used
  in dashboards, automations and other aspects your Home Assistant platform.
  - By default, Go Hass Agent ships with up around 100 sensors (on Linux),
    depending on the system it runs on.
- **Custom Sensors via Scripts:** All platforms can also utilise scripts/executables to
create custom sensors. See [Script Sensors](#script-sensors).
- **Controls and additional sensors via MQTT:** Where Home Assistant is
connected to MQTT, Go Hass Agent can add some additional sensors/controls for
various system features. A selection of device controls are provided by default,
and you can configure additional controls to execute D-Bus commands or
scripts/executables. See [Control via MQTT](#mqtt-sensors-and-controls).

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

### ü§î Use-cases

As examples of some of the things that can be done with the data published by
this app:

- Change your lighting depending on:
  - What active/running apps are on your laptop/desktop. For example, you could
  set your lights dim or activate a scene when you are gaming.
  - Whether your screen is locked or the device is shutdown/suspended.
- With your laptop plugged into a smart plug that is also controlled by Home
  Assistant, turn the smart plug on/off based on the battery charge. This can
  force a full charge/discharge cycle of the battery, extending its life over
  leaving it constantly charged.
- Like on mobile devices, create automations based on the location of your
  laptop running this app.
- Monitor network the data transfer amount from the device, useful where network
  data might be capped.
- Monitor CPU load, disk usage and any temperature sensors emitted from the
  device.
- Receive notifications from Home Assistant on your desktop/laptop. Potentially
  based on or utilising any of the data above.

### üóíÔ∏è Versioning

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Given a version
number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the gist of it is:

- A `MAJOR` number change means there [breaking
  changes](docs/BREAKING_CHANGES.md) from the previous release that may require
  manual intervention before/after upgrading.
- A `MINOR` number change means significant changes and new features have been
  added, but not breaking changes.
- A `PATCH` number change indicate minor changes and bug fixes.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

## üß∞ Getting Started

### ü§ù Compatibility

Currently, only Linux is supported. Though the code is designed to be extensible
to other operating systems. See development information in the
[docs](docs/README.md) for details on how to extend for other operating systems.

### üîΩ Installation

#### üì¶ Packages

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-agent/releases)
page and download the appropriate package for your operating system and/or
distribution:

- **Fedora**: use the `.rpm`.
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: use the `.deb`.
- **Arch**: use the `.tar.zst`.

Packages (and binaries) are available for **amd64**, **arm (v7)** and **arm64**
architectures.

For distributions not listed above, you can try the binary, or build it
yourself from source (see development [docs](docs/README.md)). Note that while
Go is known for statically compiled binaries that ‚Äúrun anywhere‚Äù, the Fyne UI
toolkit used by Go Hass Agent makes use of shared libraries that may need to
be installed as well.

Package signatures can be verified with
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). To verify a package, you'll need
to download [cosign.pub](cosign.pub) public key and the `.sig` file (downloaded from
[releases](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-agent/releases)) that matches the
package you want to verify. To verify a package, a command similar to the
following for the `rpm` package can be used:

```shell
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature go-hass-agent-*.rpm.sig go-hass-agent-*.rpm
```

#### üö¢ Container

Container images are available on
[ghcr.io](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-agent/pkgs/container/go-hass-agent).
Note that it is recommended to use an image tagged with the latest release
version over the latest container image, which might be unstable.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

Go Hass Agent runs as a tray icon by default. It is operating system,
distribution and desktop-environment agnostic and should manifest itself in any
tray of any desktop environment.

### üîõ First-run

On first-run, Go Hass Agent will display a window where you will need to enter
some details, so it can register itself with a Home Assistant instance to be
able to report sensors and receive notifications.

![Registration Window](assets/screenshots/registration.png)

**You will need:**

- A long-lived access token. You can generate one on your [account profile
  page](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/#your-account-profile).
- The web address (URL) on which a Home Assistant instance can be found.
  - Go Hass Agent will try to auto-detect this for you, and you can select it in
    the _Auto-discovered servers_ list. Otherwise, you will need to select _Use
    Custom Server?_, and enter the details manually in _Manual Server Entry_.

When you have entered all the details, click **Submit** and the agent should
start running and reporting sensors to the Home Assistant instance.

### üëª Running ‚ÄúHeadless‚Äù

Go Hass Agent will automatically detect if there is no GUI available and run in
a ‚Äúheadless‚Äù mode with no UI. Registration will need to be completed manually as
a first step in such environments.

You can register Go Hass Agent on the command-line with by
running:

```shell
go-hass-agent --terminal register --token _TOKEN_ --server _URL_
```

You will need to provide a long-lived token `_TOKEN_` and the URL of your Home
Assistant instance, `_URL_`.

Once registered, running Go Hass Agent again with no options should start
tracking and sending sensor data to Home Assistant.

If desired, headless mode can be forced, even in graphical environments, by
specifying the `--terminal` command-line option.

If you want to run Go Hass Agent as a service on a headless machine, see the
[FAQ](#i-want-to-run-the-agent-on-a-server-as-a-service-without-a-gui-can-i-do-this).

### üê≥ Running in a container

There is rough support for running Go Hass Agent within a container. Pre-built
images [are
available](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-agent/pkgs/container/go-hass-agent)
for armv6/v7, arm64 and amd64 architectures.

To register the agent running in a container, run the following:

```shell
    podman run --rm --hostname go-hass-agent-container \
      --network host \
      --volume go-hass-agent:/home/go-hass-agent:U \
      ghcr.io/joshuar/go-hass-agent:VERSION register \
      --server https://some.server:port \
      --token 'longlivedtoken'
```

- Change `VERSION` to the latest version. **Do not use latest, which is unstable and likely to break.**
- Change the value of `--server` to your Home Assistant server.
- Change the value of `--token` to a long-lived token retrieved from Home
  Assistant.
  - ***Be sure to quote the token to avoid shell escape errors.***
- We are running the container in a "one-shot" mode (specifying `--rm`) as we
  just want to register and generate the configuration file. We will use a
  different command below to actually run Go Hass Agent.

Once registered, run the agent with:

```shell
podman run --hostname go-hass-agent-container --name my-go-hass-agent \
  --network host \
  --volume go-hass-agent:/home/go-hass-agent:U \
  --volume /proc:/host/proc:ro --volume /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  --volume /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:ro \
  --volume /run/user/1000/bus:/run/user/1000/bus:ro \
  --device /dev/video0:/dev/video0
  ghcr.io/joshuar/go-hass-agent:VERSION # add any Go Hass Agent options here.
```

Change the value passed to `--name` to a unique name for your running container
and `--hostname` for the hostname that will be presented to Home Assistant
during registration.

All the other volume mounts are optional, but functionality and the sensors
reported will be severely limited without them:

- `--volume /proc:/host/proc:ro --volume /sys:/host/sys:ro`:
  - Enables various hardware and system monitoring sensors.
- `--volume /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:ro`
- `--volume /run/user/1000/bus:/run/user/1000/bus:ro`
  - Enables sensors that are gathered via D-Bus. Adjust `1000` to the uid of
    your user.
- `--device /dev/video0:/dev/video0`
  - Allows webcam control (when configured with MQTT).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the container will run as a user with uid/gid 1000/1000.
> You can pick a different uid/gid when building by adding --build-arg UID=999
> and --build-arg GID=999 (adjusting the values as appropriate).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Regular Usage

When running, Go Hass Agent will appear as a device under the Mobile App
integration in your Home Assistant instance. It should also report a list of
sensors/entities you can use in any automations, scripts, dashboards and other
parts of Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance to the mobile_app integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integration.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=mobile_app)

### üìå Configuration Location

The configuration is located in a file called `preferences.toml` in
`CONFIG_HOME/go-hass-agent/` where `CONFIG_HOME` will OS-dependent:

- Linux: `~/.config`.
- OSX: `~/Library/Application Support`.
- Windows: `LocalAppData`.

While the configuration can be edited manually, it is recommended to let the
agent manage this file.

### Script Sensors

Go Hass Agent supports utilising scripts to create sensors. In this way, you can
extend the sensors presented to Home Assistant by the agent. Note that as the
agent is a ‚Äúmobile app‚Äù in Home Assistant, any script sensors will be associated
with the Go Hass Agent device in Home Assistant.

Each script run by the agent can create one or more sensors and each script can
run on its own schedule, specified using a Cron syntax.

#### Requirements

- Scripts need to be put in a `scripts` folder under the configuration directory
  (see [Configuration Location](#-configuration-location) for the full path).
- You can use symlinks, if supported by your Operating System.
- Script files need to be executable by the user running Go Hass Agent.
- Scripts need to run without any user interaction.
- Scripts need to output either valid JSON, YAML or TOML. See [Output
  Format](#output-format) for details.
- Commands do not invoke the system shell and does not support expansion/glob
  patterns or handle other expansions, pipelines, or redirections typically done
  by shells.

#### Supported Scripting Languages

Any typical scripting language that can be invoked with a shebang can be used
for scripts. All scripts do not need to be written in the same language. So or
the typical shells can be used such as Bash, Sh, Zsh, Fish, Elvish. Scripting
languages such as Python, Perl, and Ruby can also be used.

#### Output Format

All scripts should produce output that is either valid JSON, YAML or TOML.
Scripts do not need to use the same format; you can have one script that
produces JSON and another that produces TOML. All scripts will need to output
the following fields:

- A `schedule` field containing a [cron-formatted schedule](#schedule).
- A `sensors` field containing a list of sensors.

Sensors themselves need to be represented by the following fields:

- `sensor_name`: the *friendly* name of the sensor in Home Assistant (e.g., *My
  Script Sensor*).
- `sensor_icon`: a [Material Design
Icon](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/2.0.46/) representing the
current state. It can be changed dynamically based on the current state or
remain constant. Format is `mdi:icon_name`.
- `sensor_state`: the current value of the sensor. For numerical states, without
  the units. Otherwise, a *string* or *boolean* (for binary sensors).
  - **Note:** for a binary sensor, do not enclose the `true`/`false` in quotes.

The following optional fields can also be specified, which help control the
display in Home Assistant.

- `sensor_units`: the units for the state value.
- `sensor_type`: the *type* of sensor. If this is a binary sensor with a boolean
  value, set this to *‚Äúbinary‚Äù*. Else, do not set this field.
- `sensor_device_class`: a Home Assistant [Device
Class](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#available-device-classes)
for the sensor, which will dictate how it will be displayed in Home Assistant.
There are many, pick an appropriate one (see
[`internal/hass/sensor/deviceClass.go`](../internal/hass/sensor/deviceClass.go)).
If setting `sensor_device_class`, it is likely required to set an appropriate
unit in `sensor_units` as well.
- `sensor_state_class`: the Home Assistant [State
  Class](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#available-state-classes).
  Either *measurement*, *total* or *total_increasing*.
- `sensor_attributes`: any additional attributes to be displayed with the
  sensor. **Note that the value is required to be valid JSON, regardless of the
  script output format.**

##### Examples

The following examples show a script that produces two sensors, in different
output formats.

###### JSON

JSON output can be either compressed:

```json
{"schedule":"@every 5s","sensors":[{"sensor_name": "random 1","sensor_icon": "mdi:dice-1","sensor_state":1},{"sensor_name": "random 2","sensor_icon": "mdi:dice-2","sensor_state_class":"measurement","sensor_state":6}]}
```

Or pretty-printed:

```json
{
  "schedule": "@every 5s",
  "sensors": [
    {
      "sensor_name": "random 1",
      "sensor_icon": "mdi:dice-1",
      "sensor_state": 2
    },
    {
      "sensor_name": "random 2",
      "sensor_icon": "mdi:dice-2",
      "sensor_state_class": "measurement",
      "sensor_state": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

###### YAML

```yaml
schedule: '@every 5s'
sensors:
    - sensor_name: random 1
      sensor_icon: mdi:dice-1
      sensor_state: 8
    - sensor_name: random 2
      sensor_icon: mdi:dice-2
      sensor_state_class: measurement
      sensor_state: 9
```

###### TOML

```toml
schedule = '@every 5s'

[[sensors]]
sensor_icon = 'mdi:dice-1'
sensor_name = 'random 1'
sensor_state = 3

[[sensors]]
sensor_icon = 'mdi:dice-2'
sensor_name = 'random 2'
sensor_state = 3
sensor_state_class = 'measurement'
```

For a binary sensor, the output should have `sensor_type` set to ‚Äúbinary‚Äù and
the `sensor_state` as `true` or `false` (without quotes). As an example in
compressed JSON format:

```json
{"schedule":"@every 10s","sensors":[{"sensor_name":"random 4","sensor_type":"binary","sensor_icon":"mdi:dice-3","sensor_state":false}]}
```

#### Schedule

The `schedule` field is used to specify the schedule or interval on which the
script will be run by the agent. Each script is run on its own schedule. All
sensors and their values should be returned each time the script is run. The
format is documented by the [cron Golang
package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format).
In most cases, it is presumed that the script needs to be run on some interval
of time. In that case, the easiest way to specify that is with the `@every
<duration>` as per the [example output](#examples) such as:

- `@every 5s`: every 5 seconds
- `@every 1h30m`: every 1 and a half hours.

Or a pre-defined schedule:

- `@hourly`.
- `@daily`.
- `@weekly`.
- `@monthly`.
- `@yearly`.

However, more cron formats are supported:

- `"30 * * * *"`: every hour on the half hour.
- `"30 3-6,20-23 * * *"`: in the range 3-6am, 8-11pm.
- `"CRON_TZ=Asia/Tokyo 30 04 * * *"`: at 04:30 Tokyo time every day.

> [!WARNING]
> Some schedules, while supported, might not make much sense.

#### Security Implications

Running scripts can be dangerous, especially if the script does not have robust
error-handling or whose origin is untrusted or unknown. Go Hass Agent makes no
attempt to do any analysis or sanitisation of script output, other than ensuring
the output is a [supported format](#output-format). As such, ensure you trust
and understand what the script does and all possible outputs that the script can
produce. Scripts are run by the agent and have the permissions of the user
running the agent. Script output is sent to your Home Assistant instance.

### MQTT Sensors and Controls

> [!NOTE]
> MQTT Sensors and Controls are not enabled by default.

If Home Assistant is connected to
[MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/), you can also configure
Go Hass Agent to connect to MQTT, which will then expose some sensors and
controls in Home Assistant to control the device running the agent.
Additionally, you can configure your own custom controls to run either [D-Bus
commands](#custom-d-bus-controls) or [scripts and
executables](#other-custom-commands).

#### Configuration

To configure the agent to connect to MQTT:

1. Right-click on the Go Hass Agent tray icon.
2. Select *App Settings*.

   ![App Settings Selection](assets/screenshots/app-settings.png)

3. Toggle ***Use MQTT*** and then enter the details for your MQTT server (not
   your Home Assistant server).

   ![MQTT Preferences](assets/screenshots/mqtt-preferences.png)

4. Click ***Save***.
5. Restart Go Hass Agent.

**For users running Go Hass Agent in [headless](#-running-headless) mode.**

1. Stop Go Hass Agent if running.
2. Use the `config` command option to specify your MQTT server parameters:

   ```shell
   go-hass-agent config --mqtt-server=tcp://localhost:1883 --mqtt-user=some-user --mqtt-password=superseret
   ```

   - Only `--mqtt-server` is required.

3. Restart Go Hass Agent.

After the above steps, Go Hass Agent will appear as a device under the MQTT
integration in your Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the MQTT
integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integration.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=mqtt)

> [!NOTE]
> Go Hass Agent will appear in two places in your Home Assistant.
> Firstly, under the Mobile App integration, which will show all the *sensors*
> that Go Hass Agent is reporting. Secondly, under the MQTT integration, which
> will show the *controls and sensors* exposed over MQTT for Go Hass Agent.
> Unfortunately, due to limitations with the Home Assistant architecture, these
> cannot be combined in a single place.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

#### Custom D-BUS Controls

The agent will subscribe to the MQTT topic `gohassagent/dbus` on the configured
MQTT broker and listens for JSON messages of the below format, which will be
accordingly dispatched to the systems
[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/).

```json
{
  "bus": "session",
  "path": "/org/cinnamon/ScreenSaver",
  "method": "org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver.Lock",
  "destination": "org.cinnamon.ScreenSaver",
  "args": [
    ""
  ]
}
```

This can be used to trigger arbitrary d-bus commands on the system where the
agent runs on, by using any MQTT client such as the Home Assistant
[`mqtt.publish`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#service-mqttpublish)
service.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

#### Other Custom Commands

You can optionally create a `commands.toml` file under the configuration
directory (see [Configuration Location](#-configuration-location) with custom
commands to be exposed in Home Assistant.

Supported control types and expected input/output:

- [Button](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/button.mqtt/).
  - Output is discarded. Return value is used to indicate success/failure.
- [Switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.mqtt/).
  - Return value is used to indicate success/failure.
  - When the switch is toggled in Home Assistant, Go Hass Agent will run the
    configured command with an ‚ÄúON‚Äù or ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù appended to the end of its
    command-line.
  - When the configured command is run, it should output the current state as
    ‚ÄúON‚Äù or ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù. Any additional output is ignored and any output that doesn't
    match these strings will indicate an error to the agent.
- [Number](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/number.mqtt/).
  - `display` can be optionally set in the control configuration to specify how
    the number control will be displayed in Home Assistant:
    - Either `auto`, `box` or `slider`. The default if `display` is not set is
      `auto`, where Home Assistant will decide how the control will be
      displayed.
  - `type` can be optionally set in the control configuration to specify whether
    the number control has `int` or `float` values. The default will be `int` if
    omitted.
  - Return value is used to indicate success/failure.
  - When the number is changed in Home Assistant, Go Hass Agent will run the
    configured command passing the value appended to the end of its
    command-line.
  - When the configured command is run, it should output a number as the current
    state. Any additional output is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands run as the user running the agent. Commands do not invoke the system
> shell and does not support expansion/glob patterns or handle other expansions,
> pipelines, or redirections typically done by shells.
>
> States are not kept in sync. This is most important for all controls besides
> buttons. For example, if you configure a switch, any changes to the state you
> make outside of Home Assistant will not be reflected in Home Assistant
> automatically.

Each command needs the following definition in the file:

```toml
# "control" should be replaced with one of the control types above.
[[control]]
# name is required.
# The pretty name of the command that will be the label in Home Assistant.
name = "my command name"
# exec is required.
# The path to the command to execute.
# Arguments can be given as required, and should be quoted if they contain spaces.
exec = '/path/to/command arg1 "arg with space"'
# icon is optional.
# The material design icon to use to represent the control in Home Assistant.
# See https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/ for icons you can use.
icon = "mdi:something"
# display is optional and only relevant for certain controls.
# How the control will be shown in Home Assistant. Refer to the control type for valid values.
display = "displayValue"
```

For number controls, additional configuration may be specified (default values shown):

```toml
# type is optional.
# Whether this number control has int or float values. Default is "int".
type = "int"
# min is optional.
# The minimum value of the number. Default is 0.
min = 0
# max is optional.
# The maximum value of the number. Default is 100.
max = 100
# step is optional.
# The amount to change the value by (i.e., increment/decrement), if applicable. Default is 1.
step = 1
```

The following shows an example that configures various controls in Home
Assistant:

```toml
  [[button]]
  name = "My Command With an Icon"
  exec = 'command arg1 arg2 "arg3"'
  icon = "mdi:chat"

  [[button]]
  name = "My Command"
  exec = "command"

  [[switch]]
  name = "Toggle a Thing"
  exec = "command arg1 arg2"

  [[number]]
  name = "My number slider"
  exec = "command"
  display = "slider"
  min = 1
  max = 500
  step = 5
```

#### Security Implications

There is a significant discrepancy in permissions between the device running Go
Hass Agent and Home Assistant.

Go Hass Agent runs under a user account on a device. So the above controls will
only work where that user has permissions to run the underlying actions on that
device. Home Assistant does not currently offer any fine-grained access control
for controls like the above. So any Home Assistant user will be able to run any
of the controls. This means that a Home Assistant user not associated with the
device user running the agent can use the exposed controls to issue potentially
disruptive actions on a device that another user is accessing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building/Compiling Manually

### Build Requirements

Go Hass Agent uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) for development. Make sure you
follow the instructions on the Mage website to install Mage.

### Compiling

Use the following mage invocation in the project root directory:

```shell
mage -d build/magefiles -w . build:full
```

This will:

- Run `go mod tidy`.
- Run `go fmt ./...`.
- Run `go generate ./...`.
- Build a binary and place it in `dist/go-hass-agent-amd64`.

To just build a binary, replace `build:full` with `build:fast` in the mage
invocation above.

### Cross Compilation

Go Hass Agent can also be built for **arm (v6/v7)** and **arm64** with
cross-compilation. **This is only supported on Ubuntu as the host for
cross-compiles**. To build for a different architecture, set the `BUILDPLATFORM`
environment variable:

```shell
export BUILDPLATFORM=linux/arm64 # or linux/arm/v6 or linux/arm/v7
```

Install the target architecture libraries for cross-compilation:

```shell
mage -d build/magefiles -w . preps:deps
```

Then the commands for building and packaging above should work as expected.

> [!NOTE]
> The devcontainer has all the necessary compilers and libraries
> installed for cross-compilation.

### Packages

Go Hass Agent uses [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/) to create
packages for Fedora, Arch, and Ubuntu/Debian.

To build packages, use the following invocations:

```shell
mage -v -d build/magefiles -w . package:nfpm
```

The above mage actions will install the necessary tooling for packaging, if
needed.

- Packages will be available under the `dist/` folder.
- You can build packages for other architectures as well by following the guide
  for [cross-compliation](#cross-compilation).

### Container Images

A Dockerfile that you can use to build an image can be found [here](../../Dockerfile).

You can build an image with a command like the following (using Podman):

```shell
podman build --file ./Dockerfile --network host --tag go-hass-agent
```

As with building a binary,
[cross-compliation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#cross-compilation)
is supported:

```shell
# use eitherlinux/arm64, linux/arm/v7
podman build --file ./Dockerfile --build-arg BUILDPLATFORM=linux/arm64 --build-arg TARGETARCH=arm64 --network host --tag go-hass-agent
```

## ‚ùî FAQ

### _Can I change the units of the sensor?_

- Yes! In the [customisation
options](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/)
for a sensor/entity, you can change the _unit of measurement_ (and _display
precision_ if desired). This is useful for sensors whose native unit is not very
human-friendly. For example the memory sensors report values in bytes (B),
whereas you may wish to change the unit of measurement to gigabytes (GB).

### _Can I disable some sensors?_

- The agent itself does not currently support disabling individual sensors.
 However, you can disable the corresponding sensor entity in Home Assistant,
 and the agent will stop sending updates for it.
- To disable a sensor entity, In the [customisation
options](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/)
for a sensor/entity, toggle the *Enabled* switch. The agent will automatically
detect the disabled state and send/not send updates as appropriate.

> [!NOTE]
>
> While the agent will stop sending updates for a disabled sensor, it
> will not stop gathering the raw data for the sensor.

### _The GUI windows are too small/too big. How can I change the size?_

- See [Scaling](https://developer.fyne.io/architecture/scaling) in the Fyne
documentation. In the tray icon menu, select _Settings_ to open the Fyne
settings app which can adjust the scaling for the app windows.

### _What is the resource (CPU, memory) usage of the agent?_

- Very little in most cases. On Linux, the agent with all sensors working,
  should consume well less than 50 MB of memory with very little CPU usage.
  Further memory savings can be achieved by running the agent in ‚Äúheadless‚Äù mode
  with the `--terminal` command-line option. This should put the memory usage
  below 25 MB.
- On Linux, many sensors rely on D-Bus signals for publishing their data, so CPU
  usage may be affected by the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù of the bus. For sensors that are
  polled on an interval, the agent makes use of some jitter in the polling
  intervals to avoid a ‚Äúthundering herd‚Äù problem.

### _I've updated the agent and now I've got a bunch of duplicate/removed/disabled sensors?_

- Generally, Go Hass Agent will try to reserve sensor renames to [major version
  upgrades](#Ô∏è-versioning), which may contain breaking changes.
- Unfortunately, sometimes sensor names may inadvertently get changed in
  non-major releases.
- Regrettably, there is no way to rename the sensors in Home Assistant such that
  long-term statistics and existing automations and dashboards continue to work
  uninterrupted.
- For long-term statistics, you can remove the old sensors manually, under
  Developer Tools‚ÜíStatistics in Home Assistant, for example. The list should
  contain sensors that are no longer ‚Äúprovided‚Äù by the agent. Or you can wait
  until they age out of the Home Assistant long-term statistics database
  automatically.
- For automations and dashboards the [repairs
  integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/repairs/), will direct
  you to any broken items and how to fix them.

  [![Open your Home Assistant instance to the repairs
  integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/repairs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/repairs)

### _Can I reset the agent (start from new)?_

- Yes. You can reset the agent so that it will re-register with Home Assistant
  and act as a new device. To do this:

1. Stop Go Hass Agent if already running.
2. Open your Home Assistant ***mobile_app*** integrations page:

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance to the mobile_app
  integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integration.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=mobile_app)

3. Locate the entry for your existing Go Hass Agent device. It should be named
   the same as the hostname of the device it is running on.
4. Click on the menu (three vertical dots) at the right of the entry:

   ![Delete Agent Example](assets/screenshots/delete-from-mobile-app-integrations.png)

5. Choose **Delete**.
6. From a terminal, run the agent with the command: `go-hass-agent register
   --force` (add `--terminal --server someserver --token sometoken` for
   non-graphical registration).
7. The agent will go through the initial registration steps. It should report
   that registration was successful.
8. Restart the agent.

### _I want to run the agent on a server, as a service, without a GUI. Can I do this?_

- Yes. The packages install a systemd service file that can be enabled and
used to run the agent as a service.
- You will still need to register the agent manually before starting as a service.
See the command for registration in the [README](#-running-headless).
- You will also need to ensure your user has ‚Äúlingering‚Äù enabled.  Run `loginctl
list-users` and check that your user has **LINGER** set to ‚Äúyes‚Äù. If not, run
`loginctl enable-linger`.
- Once you have registered the agent and enabled lingering for your user. Enable
the service and start it with the command: `systemctl --user enable
go-hass-agent && systemctl --user start go-hass-agent`.
- You can check the status with `systemctl --user status go-hass-agent`. The agent
should start with every boot.
- For other init systems, consult their documentation on how to enable and run
user services.

### _Can (or does) the agent run as root or with privileges?_

No. None of the built-in sensors (or commands if MQTT is enabled) require any
privileges. The agent will refuse to run if it is started with privileges. For
custom scripts or commands that need privileges, there are most likely ways for
the script/command to elevate to the privileges it needs as part of its
execution, rather than having the agent run with privileges and the
script/command inherit those.
