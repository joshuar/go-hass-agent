A [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [native app
integration](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/native-app-integration)
for desktop/laptop devices.

## üéâ Features

This app will add some sensors to a Home Assistant instance:

- Device location.
- Current active application and list of running applications.
- Battery status (for example, laptop battery and any peripherals).
- Network status (for example, network connection status, internal and external
  IP addresses and Wi-Fi details where relevant).
- Memory and swap usage (total/free/used).
- Disk usage.
- Load Averages.
- Uptime.
- Power profile.
- Problems detected by ABRT.

The code can be extended to add additional sensors. See the [development
docs](docs/development.md) for details.

## ü§î Use-cases

As examples of some of the things that can be done with the data published by this app:

- Change your lighting depending on what active/running apps are on your
  laptop/desktop. For example, you could set your lights dim or activate a scene
  when you are gaming.
- With your laptop plugged into a smart plug that is also controlled by Home
  Assistant, turn the smart plug on/off based on the battery charge to
  force a full charge/discharge cycle of the battery, extending its life over
  leaving it constantly charged.
- Like on mobile devices, create automations based on the location of your
  laptop running this app.
- Receive notifications from Home Assistant on your desktop/laptop.

See also the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).

## ü§ù Compatibility

Currently, only Linux is supported. Though the code is designed to be extensible
to other operating systems. See [the development docs](docs/development.md) for
details on how to extend for other operating systems.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-agent/releases)
page and download the appropriate package for your operating system and/or
distribution.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

**go-hass-agent** runs as a tray icon. It is operating system, distribution and
desktop-environment agnostic and should manifest itself in any tray of any
desktop environment.

### First-run

On first-run, **go-hass-agent** will display a window where you will need to enter
some details, so it can register itself with a Home Assistant instance to be
able to report sensors and receive notifications.

![Registration Window](docs/agent/registration.png)

**You will need:**

- A long-lived access token. You can generate one on your [account profile
  page](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/#your-account-profile).
- The hostname (or IP address) and port on which a Home Assistant instance
  can be found.
  - **go-hass-agent** will try to auto-detect this for you, and you can select it in
  the *Auto-discovered servers* list. Otherwise, you will need to select *Use
  Custom Server?*, and enter the details manually in *Manual Server Entry*.
- If the Home Assistant instance supports TLS/SSL, be sure to select
  *Use TLS?* as well.

When you have entered all the details, click **Submit** and the agent should
start running and reporting sensors to the Home Assistant instance.

### Regular Usage

When running, **go-hass-agent** will appear as a device under the [Mobile
App](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app) integration in your
Home Assistant instance. It should also report a list of sensors/entities you
can use in any automations, scripts, dashboards and other parts of Home
Assistant.

### üèóÔ∏è Development

I would welcome your contribution! If you find any improvement or issue you want
to fix, feel free to send a pull request!

Some documentation for development can be found in
the [development docs](docs/development.md). There is information for developing
**go-hass-agent** for different operating systems as well as adding additional
sensors. This might help anyone looking to contribute, extend or fork this tool.

### üåê Translations

While this application does not have many points where text is displayed to
the end user (logging aside), translation is supported through the `language`
and `message` packages that are part of
[golang.org/x/text](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text).

I would welcome pull requests for translations!
