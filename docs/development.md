# go-hass-agent Development

## Build Requirements

**go-hass-agent** has a number of build requirements external to `go.mod` that
need to be installed:

- [stringer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer).
  - Typically installed with `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest`.
- [fyne-cross](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-cross).
  - Typically installed with `go install github.com/fyne-io/fyne-cross@latest`
- [gotext](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/text)
  - Typically installed with `go install golang.org/x/text/cmd/gotext@latest`
- [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/).

## Development Environment

It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
This project makes use of a [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) to provide
some convenience during development.

If using Visual Studio Code, you should be prompted when opening your cloned
copy of the code to setup the dev container. The container contains a
installation of Home Assistant that can be used for testing. To start Home
Assistant, run the _Run Home Assistant Core_ task. Home Assistant should then be
available on `http://localhost:8123` for testing against.

Note that while you can also build and run the agent within the container
environment, this will limit what sensors are reported and may even hinder
development of new sensors. As such, it is recommended to build and run outside
of the container. You can still connect to Home Assistant running within the
container, as it is exposed as per above.

## Building

**go-hass-agent** makes use of `go generate` to generate some of the code. A typical build process would be:

```shell
go generate ./...
go build
```

## Packaging

**go-hass-agent** uses [Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/intro/) to create
packages for Fedora, Arch and Ubuntu and
[fyne-cross](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-cross) to create packages for
Debian.

To build a "local-only" package with Goreleaser:

```shell
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

Packages will be available under the `dist/` folder.

See the [Goreleaser docs](https://goreleaser.com/quick-start/) for more commands
and information.

To build a package for Debian with fyne-cross:

```shell
fyne-cross linux -icon assets/trayicon/logo-pretty.png -release
```

The `.tar.xz` will be available under `fyne-cross/dist/linux-amd64/`.

## Committing Code

This repository is using [conventional commit
messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). This provides
the ability to automatically include relevant notes in the
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md). The [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR)
is when writing commit messages, add a prefix:

- `feat:` for a new feature, like a new sensor.
- `fix:` when fixing an issue.
- `refactor:` when making non-visible but useful code changes.
- â€¦and so on. See the link above or see the existing commit messages for examples.
