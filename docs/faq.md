# Frequently Asked Questions

## Data/Sensors Reported

#### Q: Could this implement reporting system metrics like CPU, RAM and Disk metrics?

There are a lot of existing Home Assistant integrations that publish such
metrics. As such, this app probably won't implement sending such metrics.

## GUI

#### Q: The GUI windows are too small/too big. How can I change the size?

See [Scaling](https://developer.fyne.io/architecture/scaling) in the Fyne
documentation. Use the `fyne_settings` app to adjust the size of the displayed
windows and their widgets.
